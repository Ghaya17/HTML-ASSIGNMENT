Question 1: Define HTML. What is the purpose of HTML in web development?

Answer:  HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a programming language that's used to structure and define the content of a web page.
purpose: HTML tells a web browser how to display text, images, and other content on a page. It also provides context for search engines and designates sections of a page.


Question 2: Explain the basic structure of an HTML document. Identify the mandatory tags and their purposes.

Answer:  HTML uses elements, which are delineated by tags written using angle brackets. For example, the <img> tag introduces an image into the page, and the <p> and </p> tags surround and provide information about document text.


Question 3: What is the difference between block-level elements and inline elements in HTML? Provide examples of each.

Answer: The main difference between block-level and inline elements in HTML is that block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width of their parent element, while inline elements do not:
Block-level elements
Start on a new line, take up the full width of their parent element, and stack down the page. Examples include paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists, and all headings.
Inline elements
Do not start on a new line and only take up the space that their content requires. Examples include anchors (or links), span, input, label, and select elements. 
Here are some other differences between block-level and inline elements:
Block elements have top and bottom margins, while inline elements do not.
Block elements completely fill the accessible area from left to right, while inline elements only cover the area defined by the tags in the HTML element.


Question 4: Discuss the role of semantic HTML. Why is it important for accessibility and SEO? Provide examples ofsemantic elements.

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.
Many web sites contain HTML code like: <div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer"> to indicate navigation, header, and footer.
